    "# MISSING DATA\n",
    "\n",
    "It's usual to find missing data when working with large datasets. In fact, you might not even find a single sample free of missing data. Annoying as this is, simply ignoring missing data usually isn't an option, as it can wreck havoc if not handled properly during your analysis. If not accounted for, missing data might lead you to erroneous conclusions about your samples by resulting in incorrect sums and means, and even by skewing distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic methods for mitigating missing data:\n",
    "* Any time missing data (nan) is encountered, **replace it with a scalar value** (mean, median, mode, etc)\n",
    "* If working with time series and the data is ordered, **replace it with the immediate or previous non missing value**.\n",
    "* Another method when dealing with time series is interpolating missing data with non-nan values that come immediately before and after (interpolating methods: nearest, cubic, spline, etc.)"
